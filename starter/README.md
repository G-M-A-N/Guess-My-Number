In this project I create a game playable on the browser.
The game will accept number input ðŸ”¢ from a user.
The program will compare users input to a randomly generated computer number ðŸ”€.
The elements are queried using DOM to achieve user interface and logic functionality

The project uses Vanilla Javascript for the backEnd
The project also has index.html file which is styled using CSS.
